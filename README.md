Reflection for project one

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

We were tasked with designing a program to manage and query course information efficiently using advanced data structures.

How did you approach the problem?

The approach involved evaluating three data structures—Vector, Hash Table, and Binary Search Tree—by designing pseudocode, analyzing their runtimes, and implementing solutions to address the advisors’ requirements.

How did you overcome challenges?

Challenges included determining the most efficient data structure for sorting and querying operations. These were resolved through runtime analysis and careful design of pseudocode for each structure.

How has this work expanded your approach to designing software?

This project emphasized the importance of selecting the right data structure for a given problem and understanding the trade-offs between runtime and memory efficiency.

How has this work evolved your programming practices?

It reinforced the importance of writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable pseudocode, which is a critical step before actual implementation.
